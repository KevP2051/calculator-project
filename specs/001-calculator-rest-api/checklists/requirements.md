# Specification Quality Checklist: Calculator REST API

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- **Resolved 2026-09-01 (clarify session)**: percentage semantics (FR-007, now binary
  `(a / 100) * b`) and result rounding policy (FR-017a, exact unrounded values). No
  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain.
- All 16 items pass. Endpoint paths, HTTP status codes, request and response schemas,
  numeric types, and package layout are deliberately absent, per the constitution's Scope
  and Constraints section — these belong to Plan.
- Spec is ready for `/speckit-plan`.
